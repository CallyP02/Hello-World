# Hello-World
First tester repository for DECO2800

Hi fans,

I am a 3rd year student at UQ studying Business Management and IT. I love all sorts of technology, and I would like to work in developing things for businesses one day. I'm not 100% sure what I want to specalise in, but hopefully by doing projects like these I will get a good idea. Currently I work for Coles, as the 2IC of the dairy/ freezer department, which I have been doing for the last two and a half years.

I am a huge sports fan, mainly Cricket, football (soccer), and golf, playing these whenever I have spare time from work and Uni. I am a very keen Chelsea FC and the Brisbane Roar fan. I also conside myself quite a handyman and posess a bit of a green thumb. I like to make things and give myself a project to complete.

Cal
